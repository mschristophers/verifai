# VerifAI

## Description
VerifAI is a cutting-edge Cross-Chain Identity Management and Verification System, designed to maximize security, efficiency, and interoperability across various blockchain platforms.

Built around the robust identity verification capabilities of Worldcoin's World ID, VerifAI promises a trustworthy and reliable identity verification process. To ensure our system is resistant to Sybil attacks, we leverage the security measures of Sismo Connect. In addition, we integrate Polygon ID's Verifiable Credentials into our system for seamless, reliable identification across the Ethereum ecosystem.

At the heart of VerifAI is an AI-driven verification mechanism. This core component utilizes sophisticated machine learning models from libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. It focuses on anomaly detection and unusual activity monitoring, ensuring the robustness and safety of the platform.

To efficiently manage both on-chain and off-chain data, VerifAI integrates Airstack APIs. This allows the system to perform complex queries across multiple chains and data types without sacrificing performance. Further boosting the system's performance and making data queries more efficient, we use The Graph's indexing protocol and QuickNode RPC.

To achieve cross-chain functionality and open up our system to a multitude of blockchain networks, we use Hyperlane. Its innovative approach to permissionless interoperability allows VerifAI to perform across various blockchains seamlessly.

Lastly, we have integrated Lit Protocol into our system. This enables users to create and manage distributed cryptographic key-pairs for condition-based encryption and programmatic signing, ensuring the utmost privacy and security in all operations.
